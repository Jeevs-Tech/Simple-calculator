Calculator Webpage Project
This project is a responsive web-based calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The design features a modern user interface with a futuristic background that enhances the visual appeal of the page. The calculator performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and supports additional functions like clearing the display and deleting the last digit.

Key Features:
User-Friendly Interface:

The calculator is designed to be simple and intuitive. The layout consists of clearly labeled buttons for numbers, arithmetic operators, and functions like clear (AC), delete (DE), and enter.
Responsive Layout:

The page is styled to adjust automatically for different screen sizes, ensuring usability on both desktop and mobile devices.
Background Design:

A futuristic and abstract background adds a modern, visually appealing touch to the webpage, complementing the clean and minimalist calculator interface.
Functionality:

The calculator allows users to enter numbers and perform operations in real-time. The result is displayed immediately when the user presses "Enter."
The clear button (AC) resets the entire display, while the delete button (DE) removes the last entered number, providing control over inputs.
CSS Styling:

The project uses a professional CSS layout, with custom button styles, transparent input fields, and hover effects. The color scheme uses a mix of soft tones for buttons and bright colors for interactive elements, providing a futuristic look.
JavaScript for Functionality:

JavaScript handles the interactive part of the calculator. Functions are tied to the buttons for arithmetic operations and managing user input.
Technologies Used:
HTML5: For the structure of the webpage.
CSS3: For styling the layout, buttons, and background.
JavaScript: For the functionality of the calculator operations.
This project demonstrates how to create a functional, visually appealing calculator while focusing on clean design and efficient user interaction. It also highlights how CSS can be used to add a custom background and style elements to fit a modern web design.
